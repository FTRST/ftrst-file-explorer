# File Explorer

An application for the [futurist](https://github.com/ftrst/futurist-react) framework.

It reads data from a specific Jotai state to load faux text documents for a user to select, open, read, and close within the setup desktop environment.

## Installing the App
As with all Futurist Apps, this repo can be run isolated from the framework.

To install the App, review the installation guide here: https://docs.futurist.io/framework/app_walkthrough/

## Try It Out!

File Explorer (exp) can be utilized as a standalone [Application](https://docs.futurist.io/framework/architecture/), without any reliance on the rest of the futurist framework.

This is by design, to allow anyone to try before installing it into the larger project, should they choose to do so.

Treat it as you would any other React project:

1) Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ftrst/ftrst-file-explorer
```

2) Install the packages:
```
npm install
```

3) Run the project:
```
npm dev
```
